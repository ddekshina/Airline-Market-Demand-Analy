## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Approach

### Data Collection Strategy
1. **Primary Source**: FlightAware flight arrival data
2. **Secondary Source**: FlightRadar24 API for additional coverage
3. **Fallback**: Realistic synthetic data when scraping fails
4. **Compliance**: Respects rate limits and terms of service

### Data Processing Pipeline
1. **Scraping**: BeautifulSoup + requests for web scraping
2. **Cleaning**: pandas for data normalization and processing
3. **Analysis**: Statistical analysis of flight patterns
4. **Insights**: OpenAI GPT-3.5 for intelligent market insights
5. **Visualization**: Chart.js for interactive data visualization

### Architecture
- **Backend**: Flask web framework
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5 + Chart.js for responsive UI
- **Data Processing**: pandas for efficient data manipulation
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API for market insights
- **Scraping**: requests + BeautifulSoup for data extraction

## üîß Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- Internet connection for data scraping

### Quick Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Airline-Market-Demand-Analy
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure API keys (Optional)**
   - Edit `config.py`
   - Replace `'your-api-key-here'` with your OpenAI API key for AI insights
   - If no API key provided, the app will use rule-based insights

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Access the application**
   - Open your browser to `http://localhost:5000`
   - Select an Australian airport (SYD, MEL, BNE, PER, ADL, DRW)
   - Click "Analyze Market Demand"

### Detailed Setup

#### Step 1: Environment Setup
```bash
# Create virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Step 2: Configuration
Edit `config.py` to customize:
- Request delays between scraping attempts
- API keys for enhanced insights
- User agent strings for scraping

#### Step 3: Optional OpenAI Integration
For AI-powered insights:
1. Get an OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/
2. Replace `'your-api-key-here'` in `config.py`
3. The app works without this key using rule-based insights

#### Step 4: Running the Application
```bash
python app.py
```

The application will start on `http://localhost:5000`
